# PaymentDatePrediction
It describes about payment prediction date
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict payment dates based on historical payment data. By analyzing patterns in past payment dates, the model provides estimated dates for future payments, assisting businesses in optimizing cash flow management and financial planning.

The prediction model is trained on a dataset containing invoice dates, due dates, and actual payment dates. By learning from this historical data, the model identifies underlying patterns and relationships that influence payment dates. The trained model can then generate accurate predictions for upcoming payment dates.

To use the prediction model, users need to prepare their own dataset in the required format, configure the model settings, and run the prediction script. Additionally, the project provides functionality to train the model with a custom dataset and evaluate its performance using various metrics.
